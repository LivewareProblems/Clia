# The 99% developer

## Intro

Let's start with [Jean Yang's Strangeloop
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJA4PGKny2k) and [her post on
a16z](https://future.com/software-development-building-for-99-developers/).

## Interview fictitious quotes

- Testing: "Oh yeah we heard of it"
- Type Systems: "We would love to use it"
- understanding: "At the end of the day, we don't know what our systems does
  until it actually run in production and we look at it".

## Persona

Destiny and Ahmed.

- Have life and kids outside of software, can hardly learn and explore in their free time
- Testing is something they would like to do, for everything, but it is a lot of work to get it to work
- Call a lot of APIs
- Write jigs and glue code, maybe 1 to 10% of the time
- Mostly interact with glue code to call it
- Rarely (less than once a year) touch glue code
- No specification or intended behaviour
- Need to quickly add functionalities to a system
- Are not in this to play God. They control nothing, they are in for the ride to try to keep things running ok. Maybe. Sometimes
- Cannot test against external 3rd party services
- APIs will change, need to fix when it change.
- Mostly reactive work
- Fuck the SDLC. Real SDLC is implementation -> maintenance -> maintenance -> maintenance -> more implementation -> maintenance
- Debug mostly with logs because it works, nothing to learn.
- Use vscode or notepad++
- Ahmed use windows for his machine and linux in prod.
- onboard someone new every year. Leave after 2 years.
